                            Hyundai Marine &amp; Fire Insurance participated as a signatory to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) in 2021.
                            CDP has the longest history among global initiatives associated with climate change, and it is a carbon information disclosure initiative launched in 2000 when financial institutions around the world played the central role by urging companies to disclose management information related to their response to climate change.
                            A party that joins the CDP gains access to environment-related information from 9,600 companies around the world, and the project promotes mutual exchange among companies and investors.
                            As Hyundai Marine &amp; Fire Insurance has joined the CDP as a signatory, it has gained the right to request the disclosure of information for investment activities, and thus, it has access to the information related to the environmental management of companies, as a financial institution.
