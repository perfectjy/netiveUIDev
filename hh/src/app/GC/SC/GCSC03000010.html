                                All employees of Hyundai Marine & Fire Insurance take part in volunteer work at least once a year to fulfill their responsibilities as members of society.<br>
                                The company-wide volunteer work that has been carried out since 2005 consists of activities essential to the local community under various themes such as “safety, community, and the environment” for the facilities for children, facilities for the disabled, and facilities for senior citizens nationwide.<br>
                                In addition, Hyundai Marine & Fire Insurance's employees voluntarily partake in a variety of volunteer activities, such as those carried out with other family members and talent donation activities using their talents.

                                The Love Sharing Market is a bazaar that has been held by Hyundai Marine & Fire Insurance since 2004. To recycle the resources and spread the culture of sharing, articles voluntarily donated by all employees and Hi Planners are collected and sold to the people who need them, and the proceeds are donated to neighbors in need.<br>
                                It is held across the nation on October 17th, the anniversary of the company foundation, every year.
