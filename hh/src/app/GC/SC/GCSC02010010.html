                                            It consists of "one-to-one care support" in which a caregiver visits the hospital in person to look after children with disabilities and manages their treatment schedules,
                                            and "play classroom", which uses music and art tools to help them develop language skills and physical senses.<br>
                                            This program offers children with disabilities new pleasure and their guardians time to relax or deal with any chores they have put off.

                                            As a result of this continuous and active donation, the company joined the Salvation Army’s "Best Donor Club" and received an appreciation plaque for the "Best Shield Donor".<br>
                                            The "Best Donor Club" is a new system in effect by the Salvation Army to provide special treatment for major donors.
