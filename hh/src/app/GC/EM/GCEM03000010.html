                        <p>Hyundai Marine &amp; Fire Insurance has long maintained the principle of compliance through its guidelines for key areas that may give rise to issues in corporate activities and employees' work. In addition, the Code of Ethics not only provides standards for decisions on issues that may arise during business implementation, but also provides information on the measures to be taken for doubts and issues that may arise regarding morality and reliability.</p> 
                        <p>The Code of Ethics provides guidelines for employees to ask themselves whether they comply with ethical standards, such as whether they maintain a sincere and correct attitude at the workplace, whether their job benefits themselves, customers, and the company, and whether the corporate activities contribute to the local community and national development, and those who faithfully comply with the Code may be rewarded.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, the purpose is to instill pride in our employees to induce the improvement in their work efficiency, and enhance the company's competitive edge and customers’ trust to maximize corporate value. </p>
